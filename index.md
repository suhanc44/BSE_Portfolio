# Reflection
This project has taught me a lot about engineering and myself. I have learned about github, API keys, and javascript and along with this, I have learned about my passions. This project has showed me that computer science is something I am interested in and I am now thinking about pursuing it in the future. Overall, this project was fulfilling and I am proud of what I have accomplished.

# Final Milestone
 For my third milestone, I completed my project by combining all the parts together. The main part of this milestone was gluing the monitor to the acrylic mirror sheet. I used hot glue to secure the monitor to the bottom left of the mirror. After that, I taped cardboard to the back of the mirror to support it so it could stand on its own.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone, I focused on personalizing the magic mirror display. I did this by downloading some third party modules. First, I added a module that would display a random quote on the bottom of the screen. Next, I downloaded a spotify module which displays my currently playing song. This module was tricky, because I had to create a spotify app that would access my currently playing track and then connect that to the module using the client ID. Once I got the app connected to the module, the module was fully functioning. The last module I worked on was the default calendar module. I connected my personal google calendar to the module by using the calendar's secret address in iCal format.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up the raspberry pi and the screen. First, I downloaded linux onto my micro-SD card and connected my raspberry pi to the monitor screen. Then, I connected my raspberry pi to my computer so I can edit the monitor screen remotely from my computer. Once I had those set up, I downloaded code from the open-source Magic Mirror GitHub repository so my screen now displays the default modules such as time, weather, calendar, etc.
