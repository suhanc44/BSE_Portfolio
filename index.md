# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up the raspberry pi and the screen. First, I downloaded linux onto my micro-SD card and connected my raspberry pi to the monitor screen. Then, I connected my raspberry pi to my computer so I can edit the monitor screen remotely from my computer. Once I had those set up, I downloaded code from the open-source Magic Mirror GitHub repository so my screen now displays the default modules such as time, weather, calendar, etc.
